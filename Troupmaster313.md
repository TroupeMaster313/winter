# Project Name
3d printed all terrain vheicle 
## Summary
I am going to build an all terrain Rc model and test it on its durability and how well it can handle different terrains. This RC model will be made of 3d printed
material. This RC model will function and it moves around in different terrain and climates. I am very excited to build this becasue i have been very intrested in building
vheicles. 


## Plan
tools: 
3d printer
soldering iron
dremel tool
wire snipper
screwdriver 

steps:
1- I will print the parts required to make the vheicle with my 3d printer. 
1.1- clean these pieces up by sanding them down or grinding them with dremel tool
2- assemble and attach the components needed for this model to function. 
2.1- assemble treads needed for the vheicle
2.2-mend together pieces with soldering iron
2.3-paint
2.4- add finishing touches to model like fixing sockets. 
3- program and make the vheicle able to function. 
3.1- program moters
3.2-program the bluetooth system 
3.3-put together wires to connect motors 
3.4-put on batteries and check circulation
3.5-test the torque for the motors 
3.6- test the vheicles to see if it is working and functioning properly. 
4- test it out in the snow, and different terrains. 
4.1- test in snow
4.2- test in forest
4.3- test on sand
4.4- test compatibility on human made objects like pavement and stairs
